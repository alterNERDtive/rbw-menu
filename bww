# Bitwarden's CLI tracks unlock status using a session key. Handling this
# manually in a reasonably secure way is tedious, so this script does it for
# you.
#
# If you're still getting prompted for the master pw, run bw-unlock. We could
# detect this situation automatically, but it would add like a second to every
# invocation which is too slow IMO.

# Decrypt session file, save key to BW_SESSION.

	(echo "You need to run bw-unlock" && exit 1)

# Expose session key to bw
export BW_SESSION

# Replace this process with bw, passing along all args.
